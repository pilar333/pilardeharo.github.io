**Introduce ONE selected “Data Set” from the [awesome-datascience] GitHub with its URL and describe its potential applications and values.**

Although the actual data sets need to be updated, the [National Student Loan Data system](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/national-student-loan-data-system-722b0) piqued my interest. The columns include the school name by state, type and number of loan recipients for the 2009-2010 school year. I would identify the local state schools in Southern California and compare the number of students who are loan recipients (subsidized, unsubsidized, parent plus and grad plus). I’d request data from the past five years to better compare the rates and also find the average student retention for each campus to get a sense of how the schools are retaining students year to year. My question is, if more students are taking out loans at a higher rate are they also finishing at higher rates? I’d also dig into how many students are taking out unsubsidized loans and parent plus since those have higher interest rates. There could be predictions to be made with enough data as well.
 


**Introduce ONE selected “free-data-science-book” with its URL and author/institute Explain briefly why you are interested in this book.**

Because I’m still getting familiar with some of the mathematical applications from statistics in  data science, I’m interested in reading, ["Introduction to Statistical Thought.”](https://people.math.umass.edu/~lavine/Book/book.pdf) Based on the table of contents, I'd like to dive into Regression and Bayesian stats. I’m currently supplementing with a video course, but the more exercises and schema I can build will be helpful.
